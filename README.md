## **Disadvantages:**
- Currently We don't Support audio with video 
  > Reason: The API I am currently using is free one and it doesn't provide media with audio
- We can only provide media from reddit only
  > Reason: Reddit is the only free API i know which allows any origin to fetch data 
- We don't give data using preferences 
  > Reason: I don't have any VPS or unused pc and i don't have any money to buy it because of which I can't place backend for storing data and give preferences
